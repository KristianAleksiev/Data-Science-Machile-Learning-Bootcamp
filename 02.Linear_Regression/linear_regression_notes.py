"""
1. Defining the problem
- Formulate question to answer
- Gather the data
- Clean the data
- Explore the data and visualise it
- Train algorithm, based on pattern
- Evaluate results

About the question:
- Need to be as concrete as possible, so the data is selected appropriately
- Building a hypothesis

Linear Regression:
- Predicting the dependent variable (Target) based on Independent variable (Feature)
The relationship between the target and the feature as a line with the slope (parameters)
- Predicted value (on line) and Residuals (distance from data point to predicted value)
- The line with the smallest residuals is the line of regression (LOWEST SUM OF RESIDUALS SQUARED - RSS)

Model evaluation:
- Goodness of Fit - R squared

Cleaning the data:
- Remove the missing data, incomplete data, inaccurate data, formatting the rest
